To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. Use your fucking hands. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas.</p>
